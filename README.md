### Gameplay mechanics:
All areas are dark except for a region of cone infront of player. The player should spot the dangers lurking in the dark before moving or else face the consequences of hordes of zombies coming after them. The player has infinite ammo but a finite life which they must use to kill as many zombies as they can and score the highest before being spat to death by zombie vommit. The zombies are spawned periodically and will chase the player once they are within range so spot and kill them before they do. A directional hit indicator is shown around player to give an idea of where hit is comming from to make it easier to spot zombies that are near and dealing damage to the player.
